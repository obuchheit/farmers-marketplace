Agroforestry at Bundy Brook Farm is an land-use management practice combining trees and shrubs with crops and or small livestock.  Approximately twenty acres of riparian forest and upland buffers with native trees, shrubs, forbs and grasses comprise Bundy Brook. This ecosystem enhances filtration of nutrients from surface run-off and shallow ground water.  It also protects the water quality of the Fenton River and is an effective tool for controlling erosion and providing food and cover for wildlife."
